Answers
##1. On-time delivery ensures a software project is goal-oriented for the business, value-for-money, and stakeholder-confident. Project managers make this achievable through setting clear-cut milestones, implementing agile principles, and tracking against timelines at every point.

##2. Excellent cost management nullifies financial threats and achieves optimisation of resources, leading to a sustainable project. Methods consist of detailed planning of budgets, continuous monitoring of expenses, and leveraging cost-saving tools and methods.

##3. Agile is iterative, flexible, and suitable for fluctuating requirements, while Waterfall is linear, formal, and ideal for well-defined projects. Agile allows rapid adaptation but can be disorganized, while Waterfall provides accurate documentation but is rigid.

##4. Agile is suited for adaptive projects like mobile application development, in which user requirements keep changing, while Waterfall is suited for government software, which has high regulations and immutable requirements. Selection of the methodology depends on the complexity, size, and need for flexibility in the project.

##5. Quality assurance is ensured through constant testing, code reviews, and automated testing software, which eliminate defects and ensure reliability. Good quality enhances the satisfaction of the users, reduces maintenance costs, and lengthens software lifespan.

##6. Definition of project scope prevents scope creep and defines expectations for effective implementation. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) breaks tasks into bite-sized pieces to add organization, monitoring, and planning for resources.

##7. A solid project schedule fortifies planning, responsibility, and risk management to ensure timely delivery. Gantt charts visually portray timelines, dependencies, and progress to enable teams to coordinate smoothly.

##8. The software mitigates inefficiencies in farm produce supply chains to boost farmer connectivity and reduce losses at post-harvest stages. These conditions influence food safety, economic well-being, and sustainability among target populations.

##9. Problem definition guides development towards solving problems as they exist and ensures that features of the software are aligned with users' requirements, without duplicating effort in any way and optimizing impact.

##10. The software is an e-marketplace that streamlines the local agricultural value chain and connects farmers with consumers easily. It improves efficiency, reduces wastage, and improves market access without technical sophistication.

##11. Some of its major features include real-time price information, demand prediction, and direct farmer-to-buyer transactions to reduce intermediaries. It differentiates it from traditional marketplaces and boosts market efficiency.

##12. An expanding agricultural technology market, with increased digital adoption among farmers, offers favorable growth opportunities. Validated data from industry reports and pilot trials will validate market size and potential.

##13. Market insight situates the software favorably according to matching features with user as well as industry demands. Mobile adoption, sustainability, and supply chain digitization are trends shaping strategy formulation.
